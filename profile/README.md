# NeuroML

NeuroML is an international, collaborative initiative to develop a language for describing detailed models of neural systems, which will serve as a standard data format for defining and exchanging descriptions of neuronal cell and network models.
NeuroML is:

- modular
- standardised
- structured

and this allows you to:

- easily build detailed models of neural systems
- easily validate your models
- easily visualise your models
- easily simulate your models using a variety of simulators
- easily analyse your simulations

all using a well supported set of tools in the powerful Python programming language.
